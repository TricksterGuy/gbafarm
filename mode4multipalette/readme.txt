This demo showcases advanced mode4 usage.

There are 3 images and the export.sh exports them such that they get their own palette with a designated number of colors.

This gives you more power over the quality of the images displayed on screen if you give a lot of colors for an image then the image will look better on screen.

-start sets the starting offset for an images palette and -palette sets the number of palette entries maximum an image should have.

locations of the images can be changed in imageinfo.c
