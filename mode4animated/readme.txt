This demo showcases using an animation in mode4.

When exporting a gif (or a format with multiple frames). You get arrays for each frame of the image.
In mode 4 you also get a global palette that works for all images.

The demo code just displays each frame with a delay added before switching.  Try using the up and down arrow keys to make the animation faster or slower.
