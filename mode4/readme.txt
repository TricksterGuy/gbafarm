This demo showcases basic mode4 usage (This is the exact same as the mode3 demo but reworked to work with mode4.)

The image background.jpg is resized to 240x160.  The images palette is loaded into palette memory and is drawn on the screen.

Note there will be some loss of image quality as nin10kit automatically handles reducing the number of colors in the image to 256.
