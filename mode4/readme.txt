This demo show cases basic mode4 usage (This is the exact same as the mode3 demo but reworked to work with mode4.)

The image background.jpg is resized to 240x160.  The images palette is loaded into palette memory and is drawn on the screen.

Replacing background.jpg with your image will resize it to 240x160 
This can be removed in export.sh in that case imageinfo.c needs to be modified with the size of the image.
